# About
JumblePlace is a simple Android game to test your knowledge of the world's countries. This app was my final project for the [Developing Android Apps course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853).

Each game shows you some jumbled country names. You're supposed to guess the country from a given jumbled country name. If your guess is correct, you are awarded a point. If you guess incorrectly or you skip to the next country, you are not given any point.

## Other features
* Save your score at the end of the game and view all your past scores in one place. 
* Set how many countries you'd like to guess per game. 
* Optimized for tablets.
